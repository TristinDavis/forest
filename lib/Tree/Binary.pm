=head1 NAME

Tree::Binary - An implementation of a binary tree

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is an implementation of a binary tree. This class inherits from L<Tree>,
which is an N-ary tree implemenation. Because of this, this class actually
provides an implementation of a complete binary tree vs. a sparse binary tree.
The empty nodes are instances of Tree::Null, which is described in L<Tree>.
This should have no effect on your usage of this class.

=head1 METHODS

In addition to the methods provided by L<Tree>, the following items are
provided or overriden.

=over 4

=item * C<left([$child])> / C<right([$child])>

These access the left and right children, respectively. They are mutators, which means that their behavior changes depending on if you pass in a value.

If you do not pass in any parameters, then it will act as a getter for the specific child, return the child (if set) or undef (if not).

If you pass in a child, it will act as a setter for the specific child, setting the child to the passed-in value and returning the $tree. (Thus, this method chains.)

If you wish to unset the child, do C<$tree->left( undef );>

=item * B<traverse( [$order] )>

Tree::Binary provides a fourth ordering, called IN_ORDER. All other traversals
are handed off L<Tree>'s traverse() method.

=over 4

=item * In-order

This will return the result of an in-order traversal on the left node (if
any), then the node, then the result of an in-order traversal on the right
node (if any).

=back

=back

=head1 BUGS

None that we are aware of.

The test suite for Tree 1.0 is based very heavily on the test suite for L<Test::Simple>, which has been heavily tested and used in a number of other major distributions, such as L<Catalyst> and rt.cpan.org.

=head1 NOTES

These are items to consider adding in general.

=over 4

=item * Partial balancing

Creating an AVL search tree

=item * BTree

A special m-ary balanced tree.

=over 4

=item 1 The root either is a leaf or has 2+ children

=item 2 Every node (except root/leaf) has between ceil(m/2) and m children

=item 3 Every path from root to leaf is the same size

=back

=item * 2-3 Tree

A BTree of order 3.

=over 4

=item 1 All nodes have 2 or 3 children

=item 2 The leaves, traversed from left to right, are ordered.

=item 3 Insertion

Locate where it should be and add it. If the parent's children > 3, split it into two nodes with 2 children and add the 2nd to the parent. Continue up to the root, adding a new root, if needed.

=item 4 Deletion

Locate the leaf and remove it. If the parent's children < 2, merge it with an adjacent sibling, removing it from its parent. Continue up to the root, removing the root, if needed.

=back

=item * Red-Black

=over 4

=item 1 Every node has 2 children colored either red or black

=item 2 Every leaf is black

=item 3 Every red node has 2 black children

=item 4 Every path from the root to a leaf contains the same number of black children (called the I<black-height>)

=back

Special case is an AA tree. This requires that right children must always be red. q.v. L<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AA_tree> for more info.
