=head1 NAME

Tree::Persist

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is meant to be a transparent persistence layer for Tree and its children. It's fully pluggable and will allow either loading, storing, and/or association with between a datastore and a tree.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 Class Methods

=over 4

=item * B<connect({ %opts })>

This will return an object that will provide persistence. It will B<not> be an
object that inherits from Tree::Persist. C<%opts> includes:

=over 4

=item * Required: filename

This is the filename that is used as the XML datastore. The filename must exist and be in the appropriate format.

=item * Optional: autocommit

This is a boolean option that determines whether or not changes to the tree will committed to the datastore immediately or not. The default is true.

=back

=item * B<create_datastore({ %opts })>

This will create a new datastore for a tree. It will then return the object
used to create that datastore, as if you had called L<connect()>. C<%opts> includes;

=over 4

=item * Required: tree

This is the tree that will be used to create the datastore.

=item * Required: filename

This is the filename that is used as the XML datastore. It I<will> be B<overwritten> if it exists.

=back

=back

=head2 Behaviors

These behaviors apply to the object returned from L<connect()> or
L<create_datastore()>.

=over 4

=item * B<autocommit()>

This is a boolean option that determines whether or not changes to the tree will committed to the datastore immediately or not. The default is true. This will return the current setting.

=item * B<tree()>

This returns the tree.

=item * B<commit()>

This will save all changes made to the tree associated with this Tree::Persist object.

This is a no-op if autocommit is true.

=item * B<rollback()>

This will undo all changes made to the tree since the last commit. Essentially, it performs a reload() only if autocommit is false.

This is a no-op if autocommit is true.

B<NOTE>: Any references to any of the nodes in the tree as it was before rollback() is called will B<not> refer to the same node of C<$persist->tree> after rollback().

=item * B<reload()>

This will throw out the current tree and reload it from the datastore.

B<NOTE>: Any references to any of the nodes in the tree as it was before reload() is called will B<not> refer to the same node of C<$persist->tree> after reload().
